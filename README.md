# hello-world
My first repository

Hello. I'm following the "hello-world" guide, and it asked me to type a bit about myself. I'm currently a math PhD student, and I'm looking to go into data science after graduation. I've been neglecting the fact that I need to familiarize myself with programming a lot more than I currently am. The purpose of this account is to keep track of my progress and the projects I've done. I'm good at making plans and not caring them out, so I hope this one is different!
