# hello-world
My first repository

Hello. I'm following the "hello-world" guide, and it asked me to type a bit about myself. I'm currently a math PhD student, and I'm interested in changing fields to statistics and machine learning. Hope it goes well! I've started a github to keep track of independent projects that I'll start sooner or later.
